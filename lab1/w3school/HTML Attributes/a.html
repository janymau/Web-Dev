HTML Attributes All HTML elements can have attributes Attributes provide additional information about elements Attributes are always specified in the start tag Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value" The href Attribute The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a> You will learn more about links in our HTML Links chapter. The src Attribute The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg"> There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute: 1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg". Notes: External images might
be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed. 2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the
website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain. The width and height Attributes The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):
Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600"> The alt Attribute The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error
in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader. Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
